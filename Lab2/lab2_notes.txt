Classic Models Database
DBMS Lab – Explanation of SELECT Queries
--------------------------------------------------

This document explains the purpose and functionality of each SQL query
used on the Classic Models sample database. The database represents a
business that sells scale model cars and includes customers, employees,
orders, products, and payments.

--------------------------------------------------
Query 1
--------------------------------------------------
This query retrieves all columns and all rows from the employees table.
It is used to view complete employee information including personal
details, job titles, office codes, and reporting structure.

--------------------------------------------------
Query 2
--------------------------------------------------
This query selects only the last name, first name, and job title from
the employees table. It is used to display basic employee identification
along with their designation without unnecessary data.

--------------------------------------------------
Query 3
--------------------------------------------------
This query retrieves the first name, last name, and email address of
employees whose job title is "President". It helps identify top-level
management and their contact information.

--------------------------------------------------
Query 4
--------------------------------------------------
This query displays a list of distinct job titles from the employees
table. Duplicate job titles are removed, making it useful to understand
the different roles present in the organization.

--------------------------------------------------
Query 5
--------------------------------------------------
This query retrieves employee names and job titles and sorts the results
by first name in ascending order and job title in descending order.
It demonstrates how multiple sorting conditions can be applied.

--------------------------------------------------
Query 6
--------------------------------------------------
This query selects unique city and state combinations from the customers
table. It helps identify different customer locations without repetition.

--------------------------------------------------
Query 7
--------------------------------------------------
This query retrieves only the first five employee records. It is useful
for previewing data and testing queries without loading the entire table.

--------------------------------------------------
Query 8
--------------------------------------------------
This query skips the first ten records and retrieves the next five.
It demonstrates pagination, which is commonly used in web applications
to display data page by page.

--------------------------------------------------
Query 9
--------------------------------------------------
This query retrieves office code, city, and phone number for offices
located in either the USA or France. It demonstrates filtering using
the IN clause.

--------------------------------------------------
Query 10
--------------------------------------------------
This query is identical to Query 9 and performs the same operation.
It reinforces understanding of the IN condition.

--------------------------------------------------
Query 11
--------------------------------------------------
This query groups order details by order number and calculates the total
order value by multiplying quantity ordered with price per item.
Only orders with a total value greater than 60,000 are displayed.
It demonstrates GROUP BY and HAVING clauses.

--------------------------------------------------
Query 12
--------------------------------------------------
This query retrieves detailed order information such as order number,
customer number, status, and shipped date for high-value orders.
It uses a subquery to filter orders whose total value exceeds 60,000.

--------------------------------------------------
Query 13
--------------------------------------------------
This query retrieves employees whose first name starts with the letter
'A'. It uses the LIKE operator for pattern matching.

--------------------------------------------------
Query 14
--------------------------------------------------
This query retrieves employees whose last name ends with 'on'.
It demonstrates suffix-based pattern matching using LIKE.

--------------------------------------------------
Query 15
--------------------------------------------------
This query retrieves employees whose last name does not start with 'B'.
It demonstrates the use of NOT LIKE for exclusion conditions.

--------------------------------------------------
Query 16
--------------------------------------------------
This query combines customer numbers with contact last names and employee
numbers with first names into a single result set using UNION.
Duplicates are automatically removed.

--------------------------------------------------
Query 17
--------------------------------------------------
This query performs the same UNION operation as Query 16 but sorts the
final combined result by name and ID. It demonstrates ordering results
after a UNION operation.

--------------------------------------------------
Query 18
--------------------------------------------------
This query combines customer and employee data without aliases and
orders the output by contact last name and customer number.
It demonstrates column-based ordering in UNION queries.

--------------------------------------------------
Query 19
--------------------------------------------------
This query uses an INNER JOIN between products and order details tables.
It displays which products are included in which orders.
Only matching records from both tables are shown.

--------------------------------------------------
Query 20
--------------------------------------------------
This query uses a LEFT JOIN between customers and orders.
It displays all customers, including those who have not placed any
orders. For customers without orders, order-related fields are NULL.
